	  works.
	* altered the data dumper to manage keys properly, well, hopefully ;).

21/05/2001 - Matt Wilson <matt@mattsscripts.co.uk>
	* added native "mysqldump" support so it no longer needs to be executed
	  on the server (causing a few problems)

	  aspects of the scripts.

10/05/2001 - Matt Wilson <matt@mattsscripts.co.uk>

	  have liked to, but heres another bug fix and i'm working on getting
	  the script fully functional.

05/03/2001 - Matt Wilson <matt@mattsscripts.co.uk>
	* translations are going to be done by the following people (so far);

		Portuguese - Alvaro Carneiro <alvaro@advicenet.com.br>
		German - Rene Bogislawski <contact@seibo-media.de>

04/03/2001 - Matt Wilson <matt@mattsscripts.co.uk>
	* implementing multi-language support for (at least) portuguese, french,
	  spanish and german.
	* hopefully going to re-design the scripts with some new layouts and
	  stuff as the current javascript/popup layout is something i'm not
	  too fond of, I may go for a frames based layout, which I don't like
	  either, but it would be hopefully more functional. Also all images
	  are going to have to be scrapped due to the multi-language support
	  being implemented, all images are going to have to be plain old links.

09/10/2000 - Matt Wilson <matt@mattsscripts.co.uk>
