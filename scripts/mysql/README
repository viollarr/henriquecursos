Introduction & History
----------------------

Welcome to Matt's MySQL Panel, a user orientated web base MySQL database
administration script written by Matt Wilson <matt@mattsscripts.co.uk> and
lives at http://www.mattsscripts.co.uk/mpanel.htm (probably where you got this
archive from).

MPanel was started in October 2000 by Matt Wilson to and has been an up and
down project most of the way as with most Open Source Projects. Hopefully one
day it'll gain the all important "version 1.0".

Almost all (if not all) of the programming for this project was done by Matt
Wilson <matt@mattsscripts.co.uk> althought several other people have
contributed in one way or another (see 6. Acknowledgements).

2. Installation
---------------

For a quick installation simply upload MPanel onto a PHP enabled web server
and access the index page (ie http://domain.com/mpanel/) to be presented with
a user login page. This will then take you through to the choose database page
or alternatively the main database page (depending on user database access).
Some configuration options can also be specified...

3. Configuration
----------------

Configuration of the script is all done in the file "config.php". There are a
few configuration options, they are;

$use_language

This specified the language file to use, it defaults to "english" although the
other language files are available in the "lang/" directory. Simply replace the
value with the name of a file without the ".php" extension (e.g. english.php
is used by entering "english" for this value, castellano.php is used by
entering "castellano").

$use_login

Specifies whether or not to present the user with the login screen. This is the
default method of operation. If set to "false" and the $db_* values below are
also set then the user will automatically be forwarded to the "choose database"
page of the script. This option is most useful when used in conjuntion with a
.htaccess and .htpasswd file to secure the MPanel directory over a secure
internet connection such as SSL as the user's machine has no need to store,
send or receive the unencrypted cookies that MPanel uses for "remembering" the
authentication details of users.

$db_username
$db_password
$db_hostname

When $use_login is set to "false", the script automatically logs into the
database server and presents the user with the usual page(s), beginning with
the choose database page. These values are the username, password and hostname
(respectively) with which to connect to the database server.

4. Usage & Help
---------------

For help using the script I direct you to the appropriate "Help page" within
the scripts pages.
